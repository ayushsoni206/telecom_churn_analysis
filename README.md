# Telecom Churn Analysis and Prediction

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

 

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.

 

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

** The main goal of this case study is to find factors leading to customer churning and to predict the customer churn proactively before the customers actually churn. Further, we propose that such customers must be provided with some attractive offers or schemes to improve the their experience.**
